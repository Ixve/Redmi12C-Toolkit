# Important
This toolkit was made for earth/aether (Redmi 12C) devices - however it should be compatible with *most* other devices on the market - as it is simply a terminal user interface for ADB commands.

It's also not been thoroughly tested yet - so anything you do - you do at your own risk.

<br><br><br>Don't judge the fact the menu is a mess - like I said I made it quickly at ~2AM. It'll be improved... Eventually..
